# Fixate
Fixate is an application that helps you both identify what is distracting while allowing you to remove access to the distraction entirely. It compiles data into well formatted charts to robustly display where your time is being spent. Focus modes block any distractions you select and confine you into a productive workspace so that you can take back control over your time.
# Installation
Download the latest version through [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/powertimetracking/)

On Windows versions, a restart is required after the installation process. This is expected to be resolved in a future version.
